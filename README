This is an Asteroids clone I'm making in C++ with Allegro 5. There are no other resources required at this point in time (but be aware that the code uses C++0x features). Right now the style is terrible and I'm using Visual Studio but eventually I will transition to using Code::Blocks or Eclipse with the gcc toolchain. As of 11/19/2011 there is a brute-force collision detection algorithm (bleh), a rudimentary physics engine (basically consisting of a single function that adds vectors) and a rudimentary particle engine (alpha-blended filled circles with velocity and acceleration vectors)--so not a whole lot of interesting stuff yet.
